Parabricks
==============================

Description
~~~~~~~~
NVIDIAs Clara Parabricks brings next generation sequencing to GPUs, accelerating an array of gold-standard tooling such as BWA-MEM, GATK4, Googles DeepVariant, and many more. Users can achieve a 30-60x acceleration and 99.99% accuracy for variant calling when comparing against CPU-only BWA-GATK4 pipelines, meaning a single server can process up to 60 whole genomes per day. These tools can be easily integrated into current pipelines with drop-in replacement commands to quickly bring speed and data-center scale to a range of applications including germline, somatic and RNA workflows.
