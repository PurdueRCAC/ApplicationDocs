==============================

Description
~~~~~~~~
MILC represents part of a set of codes written by the MIMD Lattice Computation MILC collaboration used to study quantum chromodynamics QCD, the theory of the strong interactions of subatomic physics. It performs simulations of four dimensional SU3 lattice gauge theory on MIMD parallel machines. \Strong interactions\ are responsible for binding quarks into protons and neutrons and holding them all together in the atomic nucleus.
