Fftw
==============================

Description
~~~~~~~~
FFTW is a C subroutine library for computing the discrete Fourier transform DFT in one or more dimensions, of arbitrary input size, and of both real and complex data as well as of even/odd data, i.e. the discrete cosine/sine transforms or DCT/DST. We believe that FFTW, which is free software, should become the FFT library of choice for most applications.

Versions
